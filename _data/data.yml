    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a Staff Researcher in the Computing Platform Lab., <a href="https://www.sait.samsung.co.kr/">Samsung Advanced Institute Technology (SAIT)</a>.
      I received the B.S. degree in EECS and Biology (minor) from <a href="https://eecs.gist.ac.kr/eecseng/index.do">GIST</a> in 2015.
      I received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees with Distinguished Dissertation Award from the Coding and Cryptography Lab, <a href="https://ece.snu.ac.kr/en">Department of ECE from Seoul National University (SNU)</a> in 2017 and 2021, respectively.
      I am very fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://ccl.snu.ac.kr">Jong-Seon No</a>.

      I am interested in cryptographic tools for privacy-preserving computing, especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">Homomorphic Encryption</a>.
      I am also interested in post-quantum cryptography, such as code-based and lattice-based cryptography.
