    title: Short Bio
    summary: |
      I am currently working as a Staff Researcher in the Computing Platform Lab., <a href="https://www.sait.samsung.co.kr/">Samsung Advanced Institute Technology (SAIT)</a>.
      I received the B.S. degree in EECS and Biology (minor) from GIST in 2015.
      I received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees with Distinguished Dissertation Award from the Coding and Cryptography Lab, Department of ECE from Seoul National University (SNU) in 2017 and 2021, respectively.
      I am very fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://ccl.snu.ac.kr/people/professor.asp">Jong-Seon No</a>.

      My research interests include cryptographic tools for privacy-preserving computing, especially Homomorphic Encryption.
      I am also interested in post-quantum cryptography, such as code-based and lattice-based cryptography.
      I am also one of the submitters for a candidate algorithm (pqsigRM) in the first round of the NIST PQC Standardization.
